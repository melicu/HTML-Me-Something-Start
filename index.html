            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>George was born in 1901 in St. Louis, Missouri, the tenth of what would eventually be thirteen children.
               Amelia, the daughter of Polish immigrants, was born in 1903 in Shamokin, Pennsylvania, the fifth of eight
               children. Amelia eventually made her way to St. Louis, where she began working the assembly line at a
               paint spray gun and lamp guard factory. This is where, in 1919, George, a machinist working across the
               factory, first saw Amelia, and he was immediately smitten. They courted, and became engaged. But Amelia's
               parents staunchly opposed their Polish daughter marrying a German American, and the engagement was broken
               - once, twice, three times. But love prevailed, and in September of 1921, they finally eloped in his
               Model T Ford to Clayton, Missouri, where they were married before a justice of the peace. He was 20, and
               she was just shy of 18.</p>

            <h2>A Family of Eleven</h2>
            <p>George and Amelia had their first child, a boy, in 1923. Nine more children were welcomed in the
               following years, including my grandmother, their seventh child, in 1934. One son was unfortunately lost
               at birth in 1941. The family of eleven - George, Amelia, five girls, and four boys - spent the Great
               Depression living in a one&#8209;bedroom home on Beck Avenue in St. Louis, the children sleeping in
               wall&#8209;to&#8209;wall beds in the attic. George took whatever jobs he could to make ends meet during
               those hard times: fabricating obsolete car parts, painting houses, and fixing his neighbors' plumbing.
               Amelia, with the patience of a saint, took care of the home and children.

            </p>
            <p>All four of George and Amelia's sons left home to serve in World War II. Unfortunately, one of their sons
               did not return; he was killed in action at Iwo Jima in 1945, at just 19 years old. My grandmother has
               always remembered this brother so fondly; he was generous and kind, always making time to entertain his
               younger siblings and to help his mother. His death was incredibly hard on both parents, but especially
               Amelia. Years later, the three remaining sons served in the Korean War. Thankfully, they all returned.
            </p>
            <p>After the Depression, George found steady work as a machinist at a waterworks company. He remained
               there for the rest of his career, rising to foreman before retiring in the mid&#8209;1960s. Amelia's
               activities beyond the home included volunteering and playing in a kitchen band, wherein members crafted
               musical instruments from items found around the kitchen. As was the cultural norm at that time, every one
               of George and Amelia's remaining children married and had their own children, which leads us to...</p>

            <h2>Generations of Descendants</h2>
            <p>George and Amelia left quite a legacy. Eight of their children produced 39 grandchildren. I am one
               of 117 great&#8209;grandchildren. As of February of 2004, the great&#8209;great&#8209;grandchildren count
               was at 45, and the great&#8209;great&#8209;great&#8209;grandchildren count was at eight. These last two
               numbers are, of course, much higher now. But Amelia was still alive at this last count, witnessing her
               family of 217 descendants. <em><b>Two hundred and seventeen descendants</em></b>, and I am so very proud
               to be one of them. I remember visiting my great&#8209;grandparents as a child, always a little bit
               afraid of my great&#8209;grandpa and always calmed by my great&#8209;grandma, who would gently whistle to
               herself in her chair as my great&#8209;grandpa went on and on about whatever political issue was
               bothering him at the time. She always said he should have been a politician.</p>

            <h2>Final Years</h2>
            <p>You read correctly that my great&#8209;grandmother Amelia was still alive in February of 2004, aged 100.
               She was living at a nursing home in St. Louis, where her and George spent their last years. Yes, he also
               lived beyond 100. As long as he was able, George used pulleys daily to work out his arms. Amelia, her
               sight nearly gone due to cataracts, was the family's prayer warrior, always a rosary in hand. George
               passed away in January of 2004 at the age of 102. Amelia didn't know quite what to do without him, but
               she held on until March of 2005, when she passed away at the age of 101. When George passed away in 2004,
               he and Amelia had been married for 82 years. Not a Guinness World Record (we tried), but incredibly
               impressive nontheless. For perpective, the average lifespan an American at that time was 77.8 years.</p>
            <p>George and Amelia were featured more than once in the St. Louis Post Dispatch, as well as other
               publications, in celebration of their long lives and 80+ year marriage. Here are a few photos taken for a
               feature in the St. Louis Post Dispatch in August 2001, right before they celebrated their 80th anniversary:</p>

            <h2>A Bit of Advice</h2>
            <p>I hope you've found some inspiration - or at least awe - in the story of my great&#8209;grandparents.
               When asked for the secret to their longevity, George once said, <q>You have to cooperate with one
                  another. Everybody has faults.</q> Amelia replied, <q>You can't disagree about everything; it would
                  never work.</q> Also, I'm pretty sure they drank a shot of straight vinegar every day, so there's
               that. Cheers!</p>
